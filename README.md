# Credit-Card
Challenge: Write a program that calculates credit card interest for a person.

Visa gets 10%
MasterCard (MC) gets 5%
Discover gets 1%

Each card type can have multiple cards and there can be multiple wallets for a person.

NOTE: Simple Interest for this test case (means 1 month of interest, if the interest rate is 10% and the amount is $100.00 - interest in this case would be $10.00).

Here are the test cases:

  a) 1 person has 1 wallet and 3 cards (1 Visa, 1 MC, 1 Discover) - Each card has a balance of $100 - Calculate the total interest for this person and per card.

  b) 1 person has 2 wallets. Wallet 1 has a Visa and a Discover, wallet 2 a MC - each card has $100 balance - Calculate the total interest for this person and interest per wallet
  
  c) 2 people have 1 wallet each, person 1 has 1 wallet with 3 cards (1 MC, 1 Visa, 1 Discover), person 2 has 1 wallet with 2 cards (1 Visa, 1 MC). All cards in all wallets for both people have a $100 balance - Calculate the total interest for each person and interest per wallet.
